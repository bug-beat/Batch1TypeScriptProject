// Create a class for NetflixHomePage
// This class will help us test Netflix's homepage functionality

// Add 3 variables to store important testing data:
// Variable 1: Store the expected homepage title as text (like "Netflix - Watch TV Shows Online, Watch Movies Online")
// Variable 2: Store the default video quality setting as a whole number (like 1080 or 4K could be 2160)
// Variable 3: Store the maximum profiles allowed per account as a whole number (like 5 or 10)

// Add 3 methods that perform different Netflix testing actions:

// Method 1: Navigate to homepage
// This method takes no arguments (nothing gets passed into it)
// This method doesn't give anything back when it finishes
// When called, it should print a message saying it's loading Netflix homepage
// Then print a message confirming the page loaded successfully

// Method 2: Calculate monthly viewing time
// This method takes two arguments: daily hours watched as a decimal number, and days in month as a whole number
// This method gives back total monthly hours as a decimal number
// Calculate total hours: daily hours Ã— days in month
// Give back the calculated total

// Method 3: Filter content by genre and rating
// This method takes two arguments: desired genre as text (like "action" or "comedy"), and minimum rating as a decimal number
// This method gives back a list of matching movie titles (multiple pieces of text)
// STEP 1: Inside the method, create an array with at least 8 different movie titles with genre and rating
//         Examples: "action-Avengers-4.5", "comedy-Friends-4.8", "action-Batman-4.2", "drama-Crown-4.9", "comedy-Office-4.7", "action-Matrix-4.6", "drama-Stranger-4.4", "comedy-Parks-4.3"
// STEP 2: Create an empty array to store movies that match both criteria
// STEP 3: Write a for loop that goes through each movie in the array
// STEP 4: Inside the loop, split the current movie by "-" to get parts: [genre, title, rating]
// STEP 5: Check if the genre part equals the desired genre
// STEP 6: Convert the rating part to a number and check if it's >= minimum rating
// STEP 7: If BOTH the genre matches AND the rating is high enough, add the title part to your matching array
// STEP 8: After the loop finishes, give back the array of matching movie titles

// After creating your class:
// Create a copy of your class using the 'new' keyword
// Print all 3 variables from your class copy
// Call all 3 methods from your class copy
// For methods that give something back, print what they return
// For the method that doesn't give anything back, just call it
