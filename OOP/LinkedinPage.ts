// Create a class for LinkedInHomePage
// This class will help us test LinkedIn's professional networking functionality

// Add 3 variables to store important testing data:
// Variable 1: Store the expected homepage title as text (like "LinkedIn - The World's Largest Professional Network")
// Variable 2: Store the maximum connections allowed for free accounts as a whole number (like 30000 or 50000)
// Variable 3: Store the minimum profile completeness percentage for visibility as a whole number (like 75 or 85)

// Add 3 methods that perform different LinkedIn testing actions:

// Method 1: Navigate to professional dashboard
// This method takes no arguments (nothing gets passed into it)
// This method doesn't give anything back when it finishes
// When called, it should print a message saying it's loading LinkedIn dashboard
// Then print a message confirming the professional network loaded successfully

// Method 2: Calculate networking score
// This method takes two arguments: total connections as a whole number, 
// and profile views per week as a whole number
// This method gives back networking effectiveness score as a whole number
// Calculate score: (total connections รท 100) + (profile views ร 2)


// Method 3: Filter job postings by industry and experience level
// This method takes two arguments: desired industry as text (like "tech" or "finance"), and minimum experience years as a whole number
// This method gives back a list of matching job titles (multiple pieces of text)
// STEP 1: Inside the method, create an array with at least 8 different job postings with industry, title, and experience
//         Examples: "tech-Software Engineer-3", "finance-Investment Analyst-2", "tech-Product Manager-5", "healthcare-Nurse-1", "finance-Financial Advisor-4", "tech-Data Scientist-6", "marketing-Brand Manager-2", "tech-DevOps Engineer-4"
// STEP 2: Create an empty array to store jobs that match both criteria
// STEP 3: Write a for loop that goes through each job posting in the array
// STEP 4: Inside the loop, split the current job posting by "-" to get parts: [industry, title, experience]
// STEP 5: Check if the industry part equals the desired industry
// STEP 6: Convert the experience part to a number and check if it's <= minimum experience years (jobs you qualify for)
// STEP 7: If BOTH the industry matches AND you meet the experience requirement, add the title part to your matching array
// STEP 8: After the loop finishes, give back the array of matching job titles

// After creating your class:
// Create a copy of your class using the 'new' keyword
// Print all 3 variables from your class copy
// Call all 3 methods from your class copy
// For methods that give something back, print what they return
// For the method that doesn't give anything back, just call it
