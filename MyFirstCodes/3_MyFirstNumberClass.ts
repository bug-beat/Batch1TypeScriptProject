// differences with syntax
// 1 = data type is not 'string' anymore it is 'number'
// 2 = we do not have quotations anymore
let myFirstNumber: number = 26

//  the problem with the '26' is I cannot make math calculations with it
// '26' + '54' = '2654'
// 26 + 54 = 80

// I want everyone to store their imaginary retirement age and send it to me in Slack
