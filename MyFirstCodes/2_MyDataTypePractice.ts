// create variables
// print them out in a nice way

// you have to declare a variable it has to be BEFORE than you use it.
// THIS BELOW THING WILL NOT WORK.
// console.log(myDreamCar + ' does 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds')

let myDreamCar: string = 'Porshe Taycan'

// everything you want to print should stay in paranthesesis..
console.log('My dream car is ' + myDreamCar)
// output My dream car is myDreamCar

// create a string of your choice and a number of your chose as a variable 
// and after storing them print them together just like the upper examples.
// whenever you are done send it to me all the variables and the print out (console.log)

// 2 + 2 AND '2' + '2'
console.log(2 + 2)
console.log('2' + '2')

// create two number variables and print their sum with console log
let num1: number = 13;
let num2: number = 21;
console.log(num1 + num2)
